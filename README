  2. Setup two shared folders on dropbox with said friend
       ~/dropbox/for-friend-1
       ~/dropbox/for-friend-2
  3. If you are friend-1 then map the on-add-import-to-itunes.scpt to the folder actions scripts for the for-friend-1 folder, do the opposite for friend-2
  4. Change the ________ variables in share-track.scpt and share-album.scpt to point to the dropbox folders you setup.
